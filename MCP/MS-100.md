## Upload User-Mapping file to SharePoint Migration Tool

You can use the default user-mapping file when you migrate data from a local file share or on-premises SharePoint Server document library. 

 > [!IMPORTANT]
>
> For **SharePoint Server 2010** migrations, only the log-in name is supported in column A.
>
> For **SharePoint Server 2013** and later, you can use either the log-in name or the SID in column A.

For all SharePoint Server versions:

![spmt-user-mapping](https://github.com/kj-park/tech/blob/main/MCP/.media/spmt-user-mapping.png?raw=true)

Only SharePoint Server 2013 and 2016 can use this format, in addition to using a log-in name:

![spmt-user-mapping-2013](https://github.com/kj-park/tech/blob/main/MCP/.media/spmt-user-mapping-2013.png?raw=true)

 > [!IMPORTANT]
> Don't include a header row in your CSV file.

>
> **Column B:** On the target site, enter the user principal name (UPN). Required.
>
> **Column C:** If the user principal name on the target site is an Active Directory (AD) group, enter TRUE. If it's not an AD group, enter FALSE. Required.
