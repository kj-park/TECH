# [MS-100] Microsoft 365 Identity and Services

## Upload User-Mapping file to SharePoint Migration Tool

You can use the default user-mapping file when you migrate data from a local file share or on-premises SharePoint Server document library. 

 > [!IMPORTANT]
>
> For **SharePoint Server 2010** migrations, only the log-in name is supported in column A.
>
> For **SharePoint Server 2013** and later, you can use either the log-in name or the SID in column A.

For all SharePoint Server versions:

![spmt-user-mapping](https://github.com/kj-park/tech/blob/main/MCP/.media/spmt-user-mapping.png?raw=true)

Only SharePoint Server 2013 and 2016 can use this format, in addition to using a log-in name:

![spmt-user-mapping-2013](https://github.com/kj-park/tech/blob/main/MCP/.media/spmt-user-mapping-2013.png?raw=true)

 > [!IMPORTANT]
> Don't include a header row in your CSV file.
>
> **Column A:** From the source location, enter the log-in name of the user. Required.
>
> **Column B:** On the target site, enter the user principal name (UPN). Required.
>
> **Column C:** If the user principal name on the target site is an Active Directory (AD) group, enter TRUE. If it's not an AD group, enter FALSE. Required.

The Free edition is included with a subscription of a commercial online service, e.g. Azure, Dynamics 365, Intune, and Power Platform.

Office 365 subscriptions include the Free edition, but Office 365 E1, E3, E5, F1 and F3 subscriptions also include the features listed under the Office 365 apps column.

The Premium editions are available through your Microsoft representative, the Open Volume License Program, and the Cloud Solution Providers program.
